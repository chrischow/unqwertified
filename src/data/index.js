    "By the time 1873 rolled around, the typewriter featured 43 keys, all (rather counterintuitively) designed in such a way that would minimize the occurrence of breakdown - important, as typewriters were still quite expensive at the time. Also in 1873, Sholes and his colleagues entered into a deal with Remington, the well-known gun-maker. Right before the first machine developed with Remington went into production, Sholes filed another patent - this time, for the familiar QWERTY keyboard we all know.",
    "Dvorak is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout (the de facto standard keyboard layout). Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces repetitive strain injuries, or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY.",
    "Colemak is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets, designed to make typing more efficient and comfortable by placing the most frequently used letters of the English language on the home row. Created in 2006, it is named after its inventor, Shai Coleman. Most major modern operating systems such as Mac OS, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, and BSD support Colemak natively.",
    "Carpalx is an application that simulates a variety of keyboard layouts to find one that minimizes the effort of typing. The position of any set of keys can be remapped to help lower the impact on joints and wrists. Carpalx can also be used to calculate the typing effort of any keyboard layout and to profile finger and hand usage for a layout. Effort is lowered by maximizing desirable layout characteristics, such as those that lead to hand-alternation and use of home-row keys."

    "So, the truth about the history of why the QWERTY keyboard came to be is a little uncertain. In any case, by the time 1873 rolled around, the typewriter featured 43 keys, all (rather counterintuitively) designed in such a way that would minimize the occurrence of breakdown - important, as typewriters were still quite expensive at the time. Also in 1873, Sholes and his colleagues entered into a deal with Remington, the well-known gun-maker. Right before the first machine developed with Remington went into production, Sholes filed another patent - this time, for the familiar QWERTY keyboard we all know. Both the deal with Remington and the keyboard layout proved to be a huge success. In 1893, the top typewriter manufacturers merged to form the Union Typewriter Company, and agreed to feature the QWERTY keyboard as the standard design from that point forward.",
    "Dvorak is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout (the de facto standard keyboard layout). Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces repetitive strain injuries, or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY. Dvorak has not replaced QWERTY as the most common keyboard layout because QWERTY was introduced 60 years earlier and because Dvorak's advantages over QWERTY were not large enough. However, most major modern operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome OS, and BSD) allow a user to switch to the Dvorak layout. The layout can be chosen for use with any hardware keyboard, regardless of printed characters on the keyboard.",
    "Colemak is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets, designed to make typing more efficient and comfortable by placing the most frequently used letters of the English language on the home row. Created in 2006, it is named after its inventor, Shai Coleman. Most major modern operating systems such as Mac OS, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, and BSD support Colemak natively. A program to install the layout is available for Microsoft Windows. On Android and iOS, the layout is offered by several virtual keyboard apps like GBoard and SwiftKey, as well as by many apps which support physical keyboards directly.",
    "Carpalx is an application that simulates a variety of keyboard layouts to find one that minimizes the effort of typing. The position of any set of keys can be remapped to help lower the impact on joints and wrists. Carpalx can also be used to calculate the typing effort of any keyboard layout and to profile finger and hand usage for a layout. Effort is lowered by maximizing desirable layout characteristics, such as those that lead to hand-alternation and use of home-row keys. During the layout search, undesirable layout characteristics, such as those that favour low-strength fingers, are avoided. Effort is calculated by considering adjacent 3-letter groups (triads) - this permits penalizing difficult-to-type triads such as ypo, ppi, or ppl while rewarding triads such as dha, fie and sot. The effort model is flexibly parametrized and its complexity can be tuned down; for example, you can calculate effort by considering each key independently."
